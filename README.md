About
---------------------

Scribblr is a social expirement for user to collabrate in the expirence of story wirting. An author will start a 
new story by defining the story opening, the story will then become 'public' too anyone else registered to the site
these users are then able to add the next part of the story, each part will then be democratically voted on with a
voting system.

Once we have a winning ection from the voting it will be added to the story. This will go on until the 'original author'
either marks the story as finished or the story reaches a natrual end.

Users should be able to register/login to the site using the Facebook or Twitter API. The site should be in HTML 5 and CSS3
using jQuery to ensure the user expirence is smooth and seemless with the need of new page loads to be minimal.

What Needs Doing:
---------------------
- Login / Registration
- Story Posting
- Profiles
- User Dashboard
- Admin Dashboard
- Voting Tool

------------------------
Testing Enviroment
------------------------
We will eventually need to agree on where the testing of the code will be ran, so its not just locally, but for time being
local will be fine. We may need to set up port forwarding and make our local instances internet facing to ensure developers
can see the same working prototype for discussion purpose

Any developer should be able to get this running quickly by downloaidng the latest code from GIT and updating the applications
configuration file to point at there database install, this will mean the table SQL will need to be kept up to date on GIT.
